The main functionality that was applied in this project:
- UITapGestureRecognizer methods
- UIStepper properties and methods
- UISlider properties and methods

At some moment - the project was refactored to exclude a storyboard UI design. All UI is writen by code since then, but i saved my first project realisation into a separate branch, called ui_by_storyboard(before_refactoring).

Disclaimer:
The project was made for educational purposes only.

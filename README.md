This project was the third app writen by myself. It helped me to understand an UIStepper, UISlider and UITapGestureRecognizer methods a little further.
It is also the first application with a transition to another screen.

At some moment - the project was refactored to exclude a storyboard UI design. All UI is writen by code since then, but i saved my first project realisation into a separate branch, called ui_by_storyboard(before_refactoring).
